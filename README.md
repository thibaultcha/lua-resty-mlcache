# lua-resty-mlcache

[![Build Status][badge-travis-image]][badge-travis-url]

Fast and automated multi-level cache for OpenResty.

This library can be can be manipulated as a key/value store caching scalar Lua
types and tables, but is built on top of [lua_shared_dict] and
[lua-resty-lrucache]. This combination allows for extremely performant and
flexible caching.

Features:

- Caching and negative caching with TTLs.
- Built-in mutex via [lua-resty-lock] to prevent dog-pile effects to your
  database/backend on cache misses.
- Built-in inter-workers communication to propagate cache invalidations
  and allow workers to update their L1 (lua-resty-lrucache) caches upon changes
  (`set()`, `delete()`).
- Multiple isolated instances can be created to hold various types of data
  while relying on the *same* `lua_shared_dict` L2 cache.

```

The cache level hierarchy is:
- **L1**: Least-Recently-Used Lua-land cache using [lua-resty-lrucache].
   Provides the fastest lookup if populated, and avoids exhausting the workers'
   Lua VM memory.
- **L2**: `lua_shared_dict` memory zone shared by all workers. This level
   is only accessed if L1 was a miss, and prevents workers from requesting the
   L3 cache.
- **L3**: a custom function that will only be run by a single worker
   to avoid the dog-pile effect on your database/backend
   (via [lua-resty-lock]). Values fetched via L3 will be set to the L2 cache
   for other workers to access.

# Methods

new
---
**syntax:** `cache, err = mlcache.new(name, shm, opts?)`

Creates a new mlcache instance. If failed, returns `nil` and a string
describing the error.

The first argument `name` is an arbitrary name of your choosing for this cache,
and must be a string. Each mlcache instance namespaces the values it holds
according to its name, so several instances with the same name would
share the same data.

The second argument `shm` is the name of the `lua_shared_dict` shared memory
zone. Several instances of mlcache can use the same shm (values will be
namespaced).

The third argument `opts` is optional. If provided, it must be a table
holding the desired options for this instance. The possible options are:

- `lru_size`: a number defining the size of the underlying L1 cache
  (lua-resty-lrucache instance). This size is the maximal number of items
  that the L1 LRU cache can hold.
  **Default:** `100`.
- `ttl`: a number specifying the expiration time period of the cached
  values. The unit is seconds, but accepts fractional number parts, like
  `0.3`. A `ttl` of `0` means the cached values will never expire.
  **Default:** `30`.
- `neg_ttl`: a number specifying the expiration time period of the cached
  misses (when the L3 callback returns `nil`). The unit is seconds, but
  accepts fractional number parts, like `0.3`. A `neg_ttl` of `0` means the
  cached misses will never expire.
  **Default:** `5`.
- `lru`: a lua-resty-lrucache instance of your choice. If specified, mlcache
  will not instanciate an LRU. One can use this value to use the
  `resty.lrucache.pureffi` implementation of lua-resty-lrucache if desired.
- `resty_lock_opts`: options for [lua-resty-lock] instances. When mlcache
  runs the L3 callback, it uses lua-resty-lock to ensure that a single
  worker runs the provided callback.
- `ipc_shm`: if you wish to use [set()](#set) or [delete()](#delete), you
  must specify a second `lua_shared_dict` shared memory zone. This shm will
  be used as a pub/sub backend for invalidation events propagation across
  workers. Several mlcache instances can use the same `ipc_shm` (events will
  be namespaced).

Example:

```lua
local mlcache = require "resty.mlcache"

local cache, err = mlcache.new("my_cache", "cache_shared_dict", {
    lru_size = 1000, -- hold up to 1000 items in the L1 cache (Lua VM)
    ttl      = 3600, -- caches scalar types and tables for 1h
    neg_ttl  = 60    -- caches nil values for 60s,
})
if not cache then
    error("could not create mlcache: " .. err)
end
```

You can create several mlcache instances relying on the same underlying
`lua_shared_dict` shared memory zone:

```lua
local mlcache = require "mlcache"

local cache_1 = mlcache.new("cache_1", "cache_shared_dict", { lru_size = 100 })
local cache_2 = mlcache.new("cache_2", "cache_shared_dict", { lru_size = 1e5 })
```

In the above example, `cache_1` is ideal for holding a few, very large values.
`cache_2` can be used to hold a large number of small values. Both instances
will rely on the same shm: `lua_shared_dict mlcache_shm 2048m;`. Even if
you use identical keys in both caches, they will not conflict with each other
since they each bear a different name.

get
---
**syntax:** `value, err, hit_level = cache:get(key, opts?, callback, ...)`

Performs a cache lookup. This is the primary and most efficient method of this
module. A typical pattern is to *not* call [set()](#set), and let [get()](#get)
perform all the work.

When it succeeds, it returns `value` and no error. **Because `nil` misses from
the L3 callback are cached, `value` can be nil, hence one must rely on the
second return value `err` to determine if this method succeeded or not**.

The third return value is a number which is set if no error was encountered.
It indicated the level at which the value was fetched: `1` for L1, `2` for L2,
and `3` for L3.

If an error is encountered, this method returns `nil` plus a string describing
the error.

The first argument `key` is a string. Each value must be stored under a unique
key.

The second argument `opts` is optional. If provided, it must be a table holding
the desired options for this key. These options will supersede the instance's
options:

- `ttl`: a number specifying the expiration time period of the cached
  values. The unit is seconds, but accepts fractional number parts, like
  `0.3`. A `ttl` of `0` means the cached values will never expire.
  **Default:** inherited from the instance.
- `neg_ttl`: a number specifying the expiration time period of the cached
  misses (when the L3 callback returns `nil`). The unit is seconds, but
  accepts fractional number parts, like `0.3`. A `neg_ttl` of `0` means the
  cached misses will never expire.
  **Default:** inherited from the instance.

The third argument `callback` **must** be a function. Its signature and return
values are documented in the following example:

```lua
-- arg1, arg2, and arg3 are arguments forwarded to the callback from the
-- `get()` variadic arguments, like so:
-- cache:get(key, opts, callback, arg1, arg2, arg3)

local function callback(arg1, arg2, arg3)
    -- I/O lookup logic
    -- ...

    -- value: the value to cache (Lua scalar or table)
    -- nil: ignored for now - will be used in later versions of this module
    -- ttl: ttl for this value - will override `ttl` or `neg_ttl` if specified
    return value, nil, ttl
end
```

This function **can** throw Lua errors as it runs in protected mode. Such
errors thrown from the callback will be logged by this module for debug
purposes.

When called, `get()` follows the below steps:

1. query the L1 cache (lua-resty-lrucache instance). This cache lives in the
   Lua-land, and as such, it is the most efficient to query.
    1. if the L1 cache has the value, it returns the value.
    2. if the L1 cache does not have the value (L1 miss), it continues.
2. query the L2 cache (`lua_shared_dict` shared memory zone). This cache is
   shared by all workers, and is less efficient than the L1 cache. It also
   involves serialization for Lua tables.
    1. if the L2 cache has the value, it sets the value in the L1 cache,
       and returns it.
    2. if the L2 cache does not have the value (L2 miss), it continues.
3. creates a [lua-resty-lock], and ensures that a single worker will run
   the callback (other workers trying to access the same value will wait).
4. a single worker runs the L3 callback.
5. the callback returns (ex: it performed a database query), and the worker
   sets the value in the L2 and L1 caches, and returns it.
6. other workers that were trying to access the same value but were waiting
   fetch the value from the L2 cache (they do not run the L3 callback) and
   return it.

Example:

```lua
local mlcache = require "mlcache"

local cache, err = mlcache.new("my_cache", "cache_shared_dict", {
    lru_size = 1000
})
if not cache then
    -- ...
end

local function fetch_user(db, user_id)
    local user, err = db:query_user(user_id)
    if err then
        error(err) -- safe to throw: will be logged
    end

    return user -- table or nil
end

local db      = my_db_connection -- lua-resty-mysql instance
local user_id = 3

local user, err = cache:get("users:" .. user_id, { ttl = 3600 }, fetch_user, db, user_id)
if err then
    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "could not retrieve user: ", err)
    return
end

-- `user` could be a table, but could also be `nil` (does not exist)
-- regardless, it will be cached and subsequent calls to get() will
-- return the cached value, for up to `ttl` or `neg_ttl`.
if user then
    ngx.say("user exists: ", user.name)
else
    ngx.say("user does not exists")
end
```

peek
-----
**syntax:** `ttl, err, value = cache:peek(key)`

Peeks into the L2 (`lua_shared_dict`) cache.

The first and only argument `key` is a string, and it is the key to lookup.

This method returns `nil` and a string describing the error upon failure.

Upon success, but if there is no such value for the queried `key`, it returns
`nil` as its first argument, and no error.

Upon success, and if there is such a value for the queried `key`, it returns a
number indicating the remaining TTL of the cached value. The third returned
value in that case will be the cached value itself, for convenience.

This method is useful if you want to know whether a value is cached or not. A
value stored in the L2 cache is considered cache, regardless of whether or not
it is also set in the L1 cache of the worker. That is because the L1 cache is
too volatile (as its size unit is in a number of slots), and the L2 cache is
still several orders of magnitude faster than the L3 callback.

As its only intent is to take a "peek" into the cache to determine its warmth
for a given value, `peel()` does not count as a query like [get()](#get), and
does not set the value in the L1 cache.

Example:

```lua
local mlcache = require "mlcache"

local cache = mlcache.new("my_cache", "cache_shared_dict")

local ttl, err, value = cache:peek("key")
if err then
    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "could not peek cache: ", err)
    return
end

ngx.say(ttl)   -- nil because `key` has no value yet
ngx.say(value) -- nil

-- cache the value

cache:get("key", { ttl = 5 }, function() return "some value" end)

-- wait 2 seconds

ngx.sleep(2)

local ttl, err, value = cache:peek("key")
if err then
    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "could not peek cache: ", err)
    return
end

ngx.say(ttl)   -- 3
ngx.say(value) -- "some value"
```

set
---
**syntax:** `ok, err = cache:set(key, opts?, value)`

Unconditionally sets a value in the L2 cache and publish an event to other
workers so they can evict the value from their L1 cache.

The first argument `key` is a string, and is the key under which to store the
value.

The second argument `opts` is optional, and if provided, is identical to the
one of [get()](#get).

The third argument `value` is the value to cache, similar to the return value
of the L3 callback. Just like the callback's return value, it must be a Lua
scalar, a table, or `nil`.

On failure, this method returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

On success, the first return value will be `true`.

**Note:** methods such as [set()](#set) and [delete()](#delete) require that
other instances of mlcache (from other workers) evict the value from their
L1 (LRU) cache. Since OpenResty has currently no built-in mechanism for
inter-worker communication, this module relies on a polling mechanism via
a `lua_shared_dict` shared memory zone to propagate inter-worker events. If
`set()` or `delete()` are called from a single worker, other workers must call
[update()](#update) before their cache is requested, to make sure they evicted
their L1 value, and that the L2 (fresh value) will be returned.

**Note bis:** It is generally considered inefficient to call `set()` on a hot
code path (such as in a request being served by OpenResty). Instead, one should
rely on [get()](#get) and its built-in mutex in the L3 callback. `set()` is
better suited when called occasionally from a single worker, upon a particular
event that triggers a cached value to be updated, for example. Once `set()`
updated the L2 cache with the fresh value, other workers will rely on
[update()](#update) to poll invalidation events. Calling `get()` on those
other workers thus triggers an L1 miss, but the L2 access will hit the fresh
value.

**See:** [update()](#update)

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

delete
------
**syntax:** `ok, err = cache:delete(key)`

Delete a value in the L2 cache and publish an event to other workers so they
can evict the value from their L1 cache.

The first and only argument `key` is the string at which the value is stored.

On failure, this method returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

On success, the first return value will be `true`.

**Note:** methods such as [set()](#set) and [delete()](#delete) require that
other instances of mlcache (from other workers) evict the value from their
L1 (LRU) cache. Since OpenResty has currently no built-in mechanism for
inter-worker communication, this module relies on a polling mechanism via
a `lua_shared_dict` shared memory zone to propagate inter-worker events. If
`set()` or `delete()` are called from a single worker, other workers must call
[update()](#update) before their cache is requested, to make sure they evicted
their L1 value, and that the L2 (fresh value) will be returned.

**See:** [update()](#update)

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

update
------
**syntax:** `ok, err = cache:update()`

Poll and execute pending cache invalidation events published to `ipc_shm` by
other workers.

Methods such as [set()](#set) and [delete()](#delete) require that other
instances of mlcache (from other workers) evict the value from their L1 (LRU)
cache. Since OpenResty has currently no built-in mechanism for inter-worker
communication, this module relies on a polling mechanism via the `ipc_shm`
shared memory zone to propagate inter-worker events. The `lua_shared_dict`
specified in `ipc_shm` **must not** be used by other actors than mlcache
itself.

This method allows a worker to update its L1 cache (by purging values
considered stale due to an other worker calling `set()` or `delete()`) before
processing a request.

A typical design pattern is to call `update()` **only once** on each request
processing. This allows your hot code paths to perform a single shm access in
the best case scenario: no invalidation events were received, all `get()`
calls will hit in the L1 (LRU) cache. Only on a worst case scenario (`n` values
were evicted by another worker) will `get()` access the L2 or L3 cache `n`
times.  Subsequent requests will then hit the best case scenario again, because
`get()` populated the L1 cache.

For example, if your workers make use of [set()](#set) or [delete()](#delete)
anywhere in your application, call `update()` at the entrance of your hot code
path, before using `get()`:

```
http {
    listen 9000;

    location / {
        content_by_lua_block {
            local cache = ... -- retrieve mlcache instance or use your own module

            -- make sure L1 cache is evicted of stale values
            -- before calling get()
            local ok, err = cache:update()
            if not ok then
                ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "failed to poll eviciton events: ", err)
                -- /!\ we might get stale data from get()
            end

            -- L1/L2/L3 lookup (best case: L1)
            local value, err = cache:get("key_1", nil, cb1)
            if err then
                -- ...
            end

            -- L1/L2/L3 lookup (best case: L1)
            local other_value, err = cache:get(key_2", nil, cb2)
            if err then
                -- ...
            end

            -- value and other_value are up-to-date because:
            -- either they were not considered stable and came from L1 (best case scenario)
            -- either they were stale and evicted from L1, and came from L2
            -- either they were not in L1 nor L2, and came from L3 (worst case scneario)
        }
    }

    location /delete {
        content_by_lua_block {
            local cache = ... -- retrieve mlcache instance or use your own module

            -- delete some value
            local ok, err = cache:delete("key_1")
            if not ok then
                ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "failed to delete value from cache: ", err)
                return ngx.exit(500)
            end

            ngx.exit(204)
        }
    }

    location /set {
        content_by_lua_block {
            local cache = ... -- retrieve mlcache instance or use your own module

            -- update some value
            local ok, err = cache:set("key_1", nil, 123)
            if not ok then
                ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "failed to set value in cache: ", err)
                return ngx.exit(500)
            end

            ngx.exit(200)
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** you **do not** need to call `update()` to refresh your workers if
they never call `set()`or `delete()`. When workers only rely on `get()`, values
expire naturally from the L1/L2 caches according to their TTL.

**Note bis:** this library was built with the intent to use a better solution
for inter-worker communication as soon as one emerges. In future versions of
this library, if an IPC module can avoid the polling approach, so will this
library. `update()` is only a necessary evil due to today's Nginx/OpenResty
"limitations".
